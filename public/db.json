        "2 1/4 cup flour, plain / all purpose",
        "2 1/2 tbsp caster sugar / superfine sugar (sub granulated / ordinary sugar)",
        "Pinch cooking / kosher salt",
        "4 tsp baking powder (if yours is old, check it's still good)",
        "1 1/3 cup milk, full fat, slightly warmed (not piping hot)",
        "1/2 tsp vanilla essence",
        "4 large eggs, at room temperature",

        "Whisk dry – Place the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk to mix.",
        "Whisk in wet – Add milk, eggs, and vanilla. Whisk to combine. Add melted butter then whisk until lump-free. The batter should be pourable but thick – slightly thinner than pancakes.",
        "Recommended resting – Cover then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides, better flavor. Else, proceed immediately with cooking.",
        "Preheat a waffle maker. A non-stick one will not need oil, plus there is butter in the batter.",
        "Cooking – Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy – it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp – my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes, my Kmart one takes 6 minutes.",
        "Serving – Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with desired toppings. Or, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!"
