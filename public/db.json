        "Pinch cooking / kosher salt",
        "4 tsp baking powder (if yours is old, check it's still good)",

        "1/2 tsp vanilla essence",

        "Recommended resting – Cover then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 2 hours. Softer insides, better flavor. Else, proceed immediately with cooking.",
        "Preheat a waffle maker. A non-stick one will not need oil, plus there is butter in the batter.",
        "Cooking – Use a ladle to pour batter in to just cover the iron. Don't get greedy – it will leak out the sides! Cook until golden and crisp – my good waffle iron takes 3 1/2 minutes, my Kmart one takes 6 minutes.",
        "Serving – Transfer onto plates and serve as you go, with desired toppings. Or, put on a rack and keep warm in a preheated 70°C/150°F oven while you continue cooking!"
