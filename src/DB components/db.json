Season the chicken with salt and pepper and fry in the oil for 3 minutes per side until golden and crispy. Remove from the pan and set aside. 4. Add the onion to the same pan and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add the Rajah curry powder and ginger and cook for a further minute. Stir the tomatoes, chicken stock, and remaining 175 ml coconut milk into the pot. Add the chicken back in, bring to the boil then lower the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through. 5. While the chicken is simmering, cook the flatbreads. Dust the work surface with flour and divide the dough into eight balls. Use a rolling pin to roll each ball into a rough 12cm circle. Heat half a teaspoon of butter or coconut oil in a frying pan. Cook the flatbreads in batches for 3-4 minutes per side until golden and puffed up, adding more butter as needed. Wrap the cooked breads in a clean tea towel and set aside. 6. Check the seasoning of the curry. Add the spinach to the pot and stir through until wilted. Dish the curry onto plates and top with coriander if using. Serve with the warm flatbreads and cucumber raita."
